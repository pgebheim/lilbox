#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Create (or reuse) an isolated git worktree wired up for development:
# fetch first, branch from the right base, symlink env files, install deps.
#
# This is the shared worktree-bootstrap used by the /rig-worktree skill and any
# implement-style flow. Keeping it in one script means the three hard-won
# invariants (fetch-before-branch, env symlinks, per-worktree install) live in
# exactly one place.
#
# Usage:
#   setup-worktree.sh <branch> [options]
#
#   <branch>              Branch to create/check out in the worktree,
#                         e.g. alice/feat-521-rename or feat-679-observability.
#
# Options:
#   --base <ref>          Base ref to branch from. Default: origin/main
#                         (override with --base or the WORKTREE_BASE_REF env var,
#                         e.g. from vcs.baseRef in .rig/config.json).
#                         Pass origin/<integration-branch> for stacked children.
#   --path <path>         Worktree path. Default:
#                         .claude/rig-worktrees/<basename-of-branch>.
#   --reuse               If the worktree (or branch) already exists, reuse it:
#                         fetch + hard-reset to <base> instead of failing.
#                         Without this, an existing path/branch is an error.
#   --no-install          Skip the dependency install in the new worktree.
#   --install-cmd <cmd>   Command to install dependencies inside the worktree.
#                         Default: $WORKTREE_INSTALL_CMD, else "npm install".
#                         Derive from runtime.installCommand / packageManager
#                         in .rig/config.json (e.g. "bun install").
#   --name <session-name> Optional display name for the background job /
#                         session. Delegates to an OPTIONAL set-session-name.sh
#                         sitting next to this script; a no-op if that script is
#                         absent (it is not shipped with the kit).
#   --skip-if-prefix <p>  Passed through to set-session-name.sh: leave an
#                         existing name in place if it starts with <p>.
#
# On success the absolute worktree path is printed as the LAST line of
# stdout, so callers can `WT=$(setup-worktree.sh ... | tail -1)`.
